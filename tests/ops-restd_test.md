    ```
    {
        "configuration": {
            "name": "test_subscriber",
            "type": "ws"
        }
    }
    ```

 2. Verify the HTTP status code in the response is `400`.
 3. Verify the custom validation error code `10005` is in the response data.

    +------------------+              +------------+
```

### Description

 1. Connect to the switch, using WebSockets, at the `wss://SWITCH_IP/rest/v1/ws/notifications` URI.
 2. Get a list of subscribers, by name, in the database by issuing the `ovsdb-client dump Notification_Subscriber name` command on the switch.
 3. Verify the new subscriber identified by its `name` exists in the list of subscribers.
 4. Create a new subscription for the subscriber by sending a POST request to the `/rest/v1/system/notification_subscribers/SUBSCRIBER_NAME/notification_subscriptions` URI with the following data:
    ```
    {
        "configuration": {
            "name": "forward_ref_row_sub",
            "resource": "/rest/v1/system/vrfs/vrf_default/bgp_routers/6001"
        }
    }
    ```

## REST Selector validation

### Objective
The objective of the test case is to verify the *selector* query argument

### Requirements
The requirements for this test case are:

- OpenSwitch
- Ubuntu Workstation

### Setup
#### Topology diagram
```ditaa
+---------------+                 +---------------+
|               |                 |    Ubuntu     |
|  OpenSwitch   |eth0---------eth1|               |
|               |      lnk01      |  Workstation  |
+---------------+                 +---------------+
```

### Description
This test case validates the *selector* query parameter through the standard REST API GET method.

1. Verify if response has a `400 BAD REQUEST` HTTP response status code by using a invalid selector
   parameter in combination with the *depth* parameter.
    a. Execute the GET request over `/rest/v1/system/interfaces?selector=invalid;depth=1`
    b. Verify if the HTTP response is `400 BAD REQUEST`.

2. Verify if response has a `200 OK` HTTP response status code by using a *configuration* selector
   parameter in combination with the *depth* parameter.
    a. Execute the GET request over `/rest/v1/system/interfaces?selector=configuration;depth=1`
    b. Verify if the HTTP response is `200 OK`.

3. Verify if response has a `200 OK` HTTP response status code by using a *status* selector
   parameter in combination with the *depth* parameter.
    a. Execute the GET request over `/rest/v1/system/interfaces?selector=status;depth=1`
    b. Verify if the HTTP response is `200 OK`.

4. Verify if response has a `200 OK` HTTP response status code by using a *statistics* selector
   parameter in combination with the *depth* parameter.
    a. Execute the GET request over `/rest/v1/system/interfaces?selector=statistics;depth=1`
    b. Verify if the HTTP response is `200 OK`.

### Test result criteria
#### Test pass criteria

This test passes by meeting the following criteria:

- Querying a interface list with an invalid *selector* parameter returns a `400 BAD REQUEST`
- Querying a interface list with an valid *selector* parameter returns a `200 OK`

#### Test fail criteria

This test fails when:

- Querying a interface list with an invalid *selector* parameter returns anything other than
  `400 BAD REQUEST` HTTP response
- Querying a interface list with an valid *selector* parameter returns anything other than
  `200 OK` HTTP response
